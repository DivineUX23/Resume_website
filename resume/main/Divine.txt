ABOUT DIVINE:

"""
As an individual of great ambition and creativity, I am driven by an innate desire to innovate and work hard. My competitive nature fuels my drive for success, while my empathy and thoughtfulness ensure a balanced approach to life. 

I am not one to accept the status quo without question; instead, I constantly challenge existing norms and strive to generate original thoughts.

My intellectual curiosity is vast, as evidenced by my wide range of interests and knowledge. I firmly believe in the importance of expertise and scientific facts, choosing to listen only to those with proven proficiency in their respective fields. This commitment to truth and science underscores all my endeavors.

I hold the conviction that we are the architects of our own purpose. Nothing is predestined, and we have the power to expand our own luck. Moreover, I believe that those who are fortunate should extend their luck to those less fortunate, creating a cycle of shared prosperity.

Above all, I believe in making an impact. Whether big or small, the greatest achievement anyone can aspire to is improving the lives of others and leaving the world better than we found it. This belief guides my actions and decisions, serving as a constant reminder of the potential we each hold to effect meaningful change.


Long-Term Goals:

1. Technological Impact: Strive to create innovative solutions that significantly influence humanity's technological advancement. This includes contributing, either financially or otherwise, to the development and application of quantum computers, nuclear fusion, and space exploration. Specifically, I aim to contribute to the establishment of scientific bases on other planets and moons.

2. Global Health and Nutrition: Work towards ensuring universal access to high-quality healthcare, along with the effective distribution of nutritious food and clean water across all regions of the world.

3. Nigerian Economic Development: A key focus is to substantially enhance the Nigerian production economy, particularly the technology sector. I aim to develop solutions that address both local and global challenges, thereby establishing extensive global solution centers in Nigeria, created by Nigerians, for the benefit of the world.

These long-term objectives serve as the guiding principles for my decisions and actions.


Short-Term Goals:

1. Resource and Capital Accumulation: My immediate goal is to amass resources and capital in various forms, including financial assets, influence, access, skills, expertise, and personal growth.

2. Skill Mastery and Startup Development: This involves honing my skills to mastery levels and establishing solution-driven startups. These endeavors are integral to achieving my long-term goals and are not limited to these pursuits alone.
